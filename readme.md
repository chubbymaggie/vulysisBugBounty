(Underconstruction)

Scripts and data for our paper:

An Empirical Study of Web Vulnerability Discovery Ecosystems.
Mingyi Zhao, Jens Grossklags and Peng Liu, ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) 2015.


**Requirements**:

1. Python 3 (I used Anaconda)

2. MongoDB


**Bugs discovered in the paper**:

[1] In Table 1, we wrote that Facebook's bug bounty program does not disclose vulnerability reports.
Well after submitting the camera-ready version of the paper, we found out that Facebook maintain a
list of their vulnerability reports disclosed by white hats. So in a sense, Facebook does partially
disclose reports.
